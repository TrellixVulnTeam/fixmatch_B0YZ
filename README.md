Code for the paper [Can semi-supervised learning reduce the amount of manual labelling required for effective radio galaxy morphology classification?
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04357)

The code can be run by simply running the ``train.py`` script. It is recommended to use wandb as your logger, if you wish to use a different logger some source code may need to be changed (unsupported). Options are defined in the config.yml file.
